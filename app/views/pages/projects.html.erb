		<h2>Lightening Round Presentation – 10%</h2>
		<p>After you conduct user research, you’ll pitch your app idea to a panel of investors in a lightening round presentation (4 minutes maximum). The investors will decide whether your app idea is worth investing in, which will be reflected in your grade for this project. If your idea is not worth investing, you’ll have to revise and re-pitch a new idea exactly 1 week after the due date for this project.</p>
